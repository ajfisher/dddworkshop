# DDD Workshop notes for NodeBots Session

This repository will contain helpful information for installation and code
examples for the NodeBots session. Note that in the session whilst we'll be working
with some servos and some LEDs, we unfortunately won't be able to build full
bots due to the time. 

## Objective

The objective of this session is to achieve the following:

* Develop an understanding of the nodebots / johnny-five hardware stack.
* Have a dev environment fully capable of running that stack.
* Develop a network enabled device that can interact with a web service and
actuate back into the real world.

## Equipment

If you want to bring your own equipment then that is fine but we will have
kits available:

* Arduino Uno or Nano.
* LM355 or one-wire temperature sensor.
* breadboard and jumper wire.
* NeoPixel strip (min 8 pixels long).

## Installation

Install the following:

* Arduino IDE
* NodeJS
* Clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:ajfisher/dddworkshop.git && cd dddworkshop
npm install
```

## To be continued

More notes will be added here to support the workshop.
