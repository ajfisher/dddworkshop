# Gmail inbox volume

This example shows you how full your email inbox is using a servo and the
Gmail API.

## Components needed

| # | Component         |
|---|-------------------|
| 1 | Arduino           |
| 1 | Micro servo       |
| 3 | Jumper wires      |
| 1 | cardboard / arrow |

## Gmail API Set up

Derived from this [quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/nodejs).

You will need to register a Gmail API. To do this,
[go to the Google  Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=gmail)
and register your app to get your various keys.

* Select "Create New Project".
* Choose OAuth and select "Create new client ID"
* Select "Installed Application" as you'll be using this from the command line
* On the Consent Screen add in your various details that you want to call the application
* Back on the client ID details you need to ensure you select "Other" for the type
of installed application
* Click Create Client ID and you should get all your creds produced
* Download the JSON file and put it in the `2_info_radiator/gmail` folder and call it
`client_secret.json`

## Circuit

The circuit is given below. Things to note:

* Servo brown/black wire = GND
* Servo red wire = 5V
* Servo yellow / orange / white wire is signal (pin 9)

## Running the code

Now you can run the application using:

```
node 2_info_radiator/gmail/gmail.js test
```

This will go through an authentication process which you'll need to complete
and from there should print out the number of emails you have in your inbox.

You can centre your servo to 90Â° to stick your arrow on it using:

```
node 2_info_radiator/gmail/gmail.js centre
```

And finally, run the application using:

```
node 2_info_radiator/gmail/gmail.js
```

This will udpate every 10 seconds and check your current inbox status. If you
send a big volume of emails to yourself you should see your inbox start to fill
up and the arrow point to the area you consider "full".

## Going further

* Tweak the values to get a better gauge
* Use an LED to alert you to a new email
* Use the servo to hit a bell each time an email comes in.
